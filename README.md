Make me A Sweet Sandwich (MASS)<br>
</p>

## What?

I make a lot of sandwiches mainly taken from [Sandwiches of History](https://www.sandwichesofhistory.com/) 's YouTube channel.

I often am stuck with limited ingredients at home and want to figure out which Sandwich I can make. So I created this website to help with that.


## Usage

### Development

Just run and visit http://localhost:4000

```bash
npx vite --port=4000
```

### Build

To build the App, run

```bash
npm run build
```

And you will see the generated file in `dist` that ready to be served.
