Make me A Sweet Sandwich (MASS)<br>
</p>

## What?

I make a lot of sandwiches mainly taken from [Sandwiches of History](https://www.sandwichesofhistory.com/) 's YouTube channel.

I often am stuck with limited ingredients at home and want to figure out which Sandwich I can make. So I created this website to help with that.
