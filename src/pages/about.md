# What's this then?

My name is Matt. I'm just an enjoyer of ["Sandwiches of History"'s](https://www.youtube.com/@SandwichesofHistory) content on YouTube. And a web developer with too much time on his hands apparently.

The other day, my wife asked "We have nice fresh tomatoes; which sandwich are we making?". I proceeded to churn through YouTube's "in channel" search, watch every one of Barry's video which seemed relevant (guessing by the title), only to find out each time, that we were missing some of the ingredients. *Frustrating*.

So I decided to build a site where I can type the ingredients available in the kitchen, and it will suggest the sandwiches we can make.

ChatGPT provided a cool SVG logo, a quick Vitesse project was spun up, and _Voil√†_! Hmmm, now I just need to key in all the recipes *sigh*.

If you spot a broken link, a typo or have any other reason to want to contact me, please email matt.cc.kho@gmail.com
