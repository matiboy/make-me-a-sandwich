# What's this then?

My name is Matt. I'm just an enjoyer of ["Sandwiches of History"'s](https://www.youtube.com/@SandwichesofHistory) content on YouTube. And a web developer with too much time on his hands apparently.

The other day, my wife asked me which sandwich we're making next; we have nice fresh tomatoes. I proceeded to churn through YouTube's "in channel" search, watch every video which seemed relevant, only to find out each time, that we were missing some of the ingredients. Frustrating.

So I decided to build a site where I can type the ingredients available in the kitchen, and it will find the sandwiches we can make today.

Went and asked ChatGPT for a cool SVG logo, spun up a quick Vitesse project, learned new stuff about combining Javascript with SVGs, and _Voil√†_! Hmm, now I just need to key in all the recipes.

If you spot a broken link or have any other reason to want to contact me, please email matt.cc.kho@gmail.com
